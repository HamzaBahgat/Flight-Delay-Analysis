# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Delay and Performance Analysis Dashboard

This project involved the development of a comprehensive, interactive **Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard** using **Power BI**. The analysis leverages a large dataset of **$1.94$ million domestic flight records** sourced from **Kaggle** to identify and analyze key drivers of flight delays, cancellations, and diversions.

## üí° Key Insights and Dashboard Views

The project is structured across multiple intuitive pages to guide the user through the analysis:

### 1. Overview Dashboard (Focus: System-Wide Performance)

* **Key Findings:** Identification of the largest volume operators (e.g., **Southwest Airlines**, **American Airlines**) and the overall on-time performance rate.
* **Trend Analysis:** Visualization of the spike in **Cancelled Trips** during **December** (Qtr4), crucial for seasonal resource planning.

### 2. Airports Dashboard (Focus: Delays and Carrier Performance)

* **Delay Hotspots:** Pinpoints major delay centers like **Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International** ($120$K delays) and **Chicago O'Hare International** ($115$K delays).
* **Carrier Severity:** Reveals carriers with the most severe average arrival delays (e.g., **AirTran**), guiding targeted quality improvement efforts.

### 3. Routes Analysis Dashboard (Focus: Operational Efficiency)

* **Operational Bottlenecks:** Analysis of **Taxi times** identifies airports like **Los Angeles International** and **Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International** as having the longest average taxi times, indicating potential ground congestion issues.
* **Diversions:** Tracks the monthly trend of diverted flights, which also peaks significantly in **December**.
